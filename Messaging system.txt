Connector will have 



Creating Chatrooms:
When adding someone as a friend, it should make a new chat room 


Search for messages, will show you all the chatrooms that you are a part of

Search for friends, will let you make a new chatroom with a chosen friend

Search for all users will let you add friends, or to make a new chat room with that user




When making a new chatroom:
It will take the sender and recipient
It will create a new chatroom and give it a name (recipient username " & " sender username by default)

It will create two connectors
One for the sender and one for the recipient
(settings can change if you automatically want to be connected as a recipient) (accept message request from strangers)



Think about:

When a user result is shown it should show underneath it
All the chat rooms that you are they are a part of
it can still make a chat room when adding a friend 
but if you want, you can join a chat room too from the search for friends/users page
