Summary
User search result should not have a link to add friends if you already have a friend request sent to them

Reason
The user search does not check if a friend connection exists, it just outputs the same result format regardless

Fix
Check if a friend connection exists between the user doing the search and the search result and output the results accordingly






Summary
On page load, if there are enough messages to create a scroll bar, the messages don't scroll to the bottom once the messages are loaded

Reason
I think the page doesn't scroll down immediately because JavaScript is asynchronous and Ajax doesn't wait to do next line of code.
the chat box was scrolled to the bottom before all the messages are processed

Potential Fix
To scroll to the bottom of the chat box on page load maybe think about setting a timeout JavaScript for Loop for a few milliseconds after the page load.






Summary
Users are able to see chats that they are not a part of (maybe as a result of the adding new members to chatrooms)

Reason
The code that writes out the messages doesn't check if the user is a memeber of the chat

Potential fix
Check if the user has access to the chatroom in the ajax call

Fixed
The check for if the user is a member only checked "if the user had a connector with their id"
It should have checked "if there was a connector with their id AND the current chatroom id"
Any user was able to access any chat providing they had at least one connector




Summary
If the user does not have "ChatRoomID" in their url, recent messages and some of the banner does not show up

Reason
Page checks if chatroom is in the url before doing ajax calls

Potential Fix
Only check for the ChatRoomID for the "getmessages" ajax call
For the recent messages call, if there isn't a chatroomid then set a variable to -1 and pass that through (that way none of the recent chats will come up grey)
