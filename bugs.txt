Problem
Use search shows
User search result should not have a link to add friends if you already have a friend request sent to them

Reason
The user search does not check if a friend connection exists, it just outputs the same result format regardless

Fix
Check if a friend connection exists between the user doing the search and the search result and output the results accordingly






Summary
On page load, if there are enough messages to create a scroll bar, the messages don't scroll to the bottom once the messages are loaded

Reason
I think the page doesn't scroll down immediately because JavaScript is asynchronous and Ajax doesn't wait to do next line of code.
the chat box was scrolled to the bottom before all the messages are processed

Potential Fix
To scroll to the bottom of the chat box on page load maybe think about setting a timeout JavaScript for Loop for a few milliseconds after the page load.
