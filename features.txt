Working on:

general styling

Consistant naming {
	ChatID - has been called ChatRoomID (maybe use the long variable (that is what it is in the database))
}


show users in the users results box without having to search 
(maybe mutuals (check friend's connections and save how many times each friend show up and output most common first))

spa arcitechure

messages to self

should not say sent by a person more than once in a row (when outputting message, store who the last sent message was from)

use dv rather than % to get use a percent of the screen height for the chatbox

move all database connections after checking if the .php file was opened correctly (after checking for posts or session ids)



Chatroom:
check if the two users were friends before setting the connecetors to connected

take the getmaxid function from zAccountCreate and use it in zChatroomCreate

move adding connectors and setting id's to inside the check for if the initial statement worked

shouldn't be able to make a new chat with a friend (or maybe leave this in)

should be able to make a new chat on your own (so that you can add people to it afterwards)

Chat settings{
add/remove members
edit admin rights
passwords
}

adding more people to chats {
Connectors have an admin right attribute
the person who made the chat will get admin rights (both in the case of a new chat from friend accept)
admins can promote others to admin, and can add new users to the chat
}

change the pulling of chat members to not be ajax

chat name should be the people in the chat's names by default



Friends:
Friend result should have the option to remove friend



Messages:
messages should be store the time sent

unread chats should come up in notifications

unread messages{
Notifications tab pulls all unread chats as notifications
}

Use a toggle to turn off auto scroll
If I do this then I will have to think about how the top message doesn't get unloaded, 
right now it always pulls the top-10 messages but if I scrolled to the top and I'm looking at the top message the top one we'll go away once a new message is recieved, 
so I need to check if there's a new message and change the  number of pulled messages to 11 rather than pulling top 10. that way the top one stays. 
To do this i can do the following check: 
	once I've pulled a set of messages save a JavaScript variable that is the biggest ID of the messages from the messages that were just pulled 
	each time I pull messages check if the biggest ID of the one that was just pulled is bigger than the previous biggest ID 
	if it is then we need to increase the number of pulled messages to one more than before 
	(or increase it by however many more messages were pulled that had a bigger id than the previous biggest id)

Add a button to scroll to the bottom when auto scroll is turned off 
this way the user would not have to scroll down to the bottom manually 
instead when they click that button and it scrolls to the button and auto scroll is turned back on

If there was more messages than the amount requested to pull, 
the first element in the chatbox should be an ajax button to increase the amount of pulled messages 
("load more messages" button right at the top)

If there was a new message (read was false during the load messages sequence)
output the following script using php 
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_audio_play
(replace the sound with a ping sound) 
(and call the play function rather than have it on click)




Make account:
email for forgotten password
so a user should have to enter an email address when signing up



Searching messages:



Search for people:
should show the accept friend request if the user has a friend request from them


Security {
	all variables pulled from the URL or inputs are done using mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $variable)
	
	`if (!isset($_SESSION['userID'])) header("Location: login.php");` is used at the start of all pages that need to be logged in
	
	Pages that don't have ui should not be able to be opened unlessthe correct post/get are present
	
	User must be logged in and has must have the right connector to access pulling/pushing from/to the database
}



Settings:
Dark mode/ themes, use php to load the correct css file depending on the user settings

show ids after names



FeedBack:
Feeback entry in the database should take the user id and a viewed value
If there is more than 3 feedback items from the current user that are unviewed, don't let them make another
Message: "You have submitted 3 feedback tickets that still have not been viewed by a developer, please come back at a later date (or contact the developer yourself if you know him)"
