Friends:
Clicking on a friend lets you either remove friend

When accepting a friend request, check to see that the request existed, 
make sure that the recipient is the one accepting ($_SESSION['userID'])

adding a friend should create two friend entities in the database (one for each person)
rather than just one. This way searching friends is easier



Messages:
messages should be accompanied with the time sent

messages should have a read status (maybe recieved status)

No message should show (Hmm, there are no messages here, why not send one?)



Make account:
email for forgotten password



Searching messages:



Search for people:
If they are not your friend, it should have a link to add them as a friend
should not have a link to add friends if you already have a friend request sent to them



Settings:
Dark mode
show ids after names
