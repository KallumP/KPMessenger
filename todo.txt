show all users without having to search anything
general styling
Consistant naming {
	ChatID - has been called ChatRoomID (maybe use the long variable (that is what it is in the database))

General:
pulls all database data into sql safe variables {
	mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, variable)
	search for any thing with $_GET, $_POST and any messages that are pulled (chatroom, chat preview, notes)
}
spa arcitechure
messages to self
should not say sent by a person more than once in a row (when outputting message, store who the last sent message was from)
make the chatroom size a bit more defined (put more screensize changes in css)
move all database connections after checking if the .php file was opened correctly (after checking for posts or session ids)



Chatroom:
check if the two users were friends before setting the connecetors to connected
take the getmaxid from zAccountCreate and use it in zChatroomCreate
move adding connectors and setting id's to inside the check for if the initial statement worked
shouldn't be able to make a new chat with a friend (or maybe leave this in)
should be able to make a new chat on your own (so that you can add people to it afterwards)
Chat settings{
Rename chat
add/remove members
edit admin rights
passwords
}
chat name should be the people in the chat's names by default



Friends:
Clicking on a friend lets you either remove friend



Messages:
messages should be accompanied with the time sent

unread chats should come up in notifications

unread messages{
Notifications tab pulls all unread chats as notifications
}

Scroll to bottom of chat{
It should check if the div was scrolled up a bit before scrolling down
}

If there was a new message (read was false during the load messages sequence)
output the following script using php 
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_audio_play
(replace the sound with a ping sound) 
(and call the play function rather than have it on click)




Connectors:
adding more people to chats {
Connectors have an admin right attribute
the person who made the chat will get admin rights (both in the case of a new chat from friend accept)
admins can promote others to admin, and can add new users to the chat
}



Make account:
email for forgotten password
so a user should have to enter an email address when signing up



Searching messages:



Search for people:
If they are not your friend, it should have a link to add them as a friend
should not have a link to add friends if you already have a friend request sent to them
should show the accept friend request if the user has a friend request from them



Settings:
Dark mode/ themes, use php to load the correct css file depending on the user settings
show ids after names
