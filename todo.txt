Working on:
show all users without having to search anything
general styling

General:
pulls all database data into sql safe variables
spa arcitechure
messages to self
should not say sent by a person more than once in a row (when outputting message, store who the last sent message was from)
make the chatroom size a bit more defined (put more screensize changes in css)
move all database connections after checking if the .php file was opene correctly (after checking for posts or session ids)



Chatroom:
check if the two users were friends before setting the connecetors to connected
take the getmaxid from zAccountCreate and use it in zChatroomCreate
move adding connectors and setting id's to inside the check for if the initial statement worked
shouldn't be able to make a new chat with a friend (or maybe leave this in)
should be able to make a new chat on your own (so that you can add people to it afterwards)
Chat settings{
Rename chat
add/remove members
edit admin rights
passwords
}
chat name should be the people in the chat's names by default



Friends:
Clicking on a friend lets you either remove friend



Messages:
messages should be accompanied with the time sent

messages should have a read status (maybe recieved status)

unread messages{
Connectors should have a "read" attribute
Sending a message, should set the read attribute to false
Notifications tab pulls all unread chats as notifications
unread chats have a different color in recetn messages box
When sending a message it should set all connectors from that chat to unread
Loading the chat will set your connector to read (this will happen on long polling too)
}

There should be no get messages code in index.php
On document ready it should call loadmessages
and then scroll to the bottom
On a timer it should call loadmessages and but don't scroll unless there was a new message

the js should have some php to check the connector if the read status was false
zLoadMessages.php should only be called if the above was true. js should scroll to the bottom if the above was true
Maybe if the read status is detected as false, the name can be updated with a button to allow the user to scroll to the bottom



Connectors:
adding more people to chats {
Connectors have an admin right attribute
the person who made the chat will get admin rights (both in the case of a new chat from friend accept)
admins can promote others to admin, and can add new users to the chat
}



Make account:
email for forgotten password
so a user should have to enter an email address when signing up



Searching messages:



Search for people:
If they are not your friend, it should have a link to add them as a friend
should not have a link to add friends if you already have a friend request sent to them
should show the accept friend request if the user has a friend request from them



Settings:
Dark mode/ themes, use php to load the correct css file depending on the user settings
show ids after names
