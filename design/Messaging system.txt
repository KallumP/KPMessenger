Search for friends will only show you all your friends (these are shown before a search term is submited)

Search for users will show you any user (non are shown before the search term is submitted)

When adding a sending a friend request to a user, only a friend request is created in the database

When accepting a friend request, a chatroom and two friend connectors are made (one for each person) in the database
Because this is a chatroom made by a friendrequest acceptance. Both users will be admins.

When creating a new chat (not made through accepting a friend request) the person making the chat will be admin, the other user won't be admin
